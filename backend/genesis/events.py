"""Event bridge — Genesis events → external listeners (e.g. WebSocket broadcaster).

Genesis modules emit events via `emit(event_type, payload)`. The web layer
registers a listener with `subscribe(callback)`. This decouples runtime/dreams
from FastAPI.

All Genesis events have shape:
    {
        "type": "organism.<verb>",   # see EVENT_TYPES below
        "organism_id": "o_...",
        "ts": "2026-...",
        ... event-specific fields ...
