"""Core data types for digital organisms.

The whole system revolves around these. Everything else is plumbing.

Key insight: there is NO `Workflow` type. There is only `Organism` (a living
thing with intent + memory + body) and `Decision` (an event in its causal
history). Workflows don't exist in Genesis — they were never the right
abstraction.
